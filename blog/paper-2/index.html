However, the generated molecules tend to closely resemble those in the training distribution, restricting their usefulness in discovering truly novel compounds with superior therapeutic potential. This is especially problematic when aiming to avoid patented scaffolds or explore uncharted regions of the chemical space. Moreover, real-world drug design often requires satisfying multiple complex property constraints, such as high binding affinity, drug-likeness, and synthesizability. Most existing models optimize simplistic proxy scores, which often result in trivial or unrealistic structures. This blog introduces <strong>MOOD</strong> (Molecular Out-Of-distribution Diffusion), a novel score-based generative framework that addresses these limitations by enabling controlled exploration beyond the training data, while optimizing for multiple drug-relevant properties.</p> <h2 id="limitations-of-existing-models">Limitations of Existing Models</h2> <p>Prior works for molecular generation, such as VAE <d-cite key="G_mez_Bombarelli_2018"></d-cite>, GANs <d-cite key="decao2022molganimplicitgenerativemodel"></d-cite>, and reinforcement learning-based models <d-cite key="olivecrona2017molecularnovodesigndeep"></d-cite>, primarily rely on learning distributions from existing molecular datasets. As a result, they exhibit a strong inductive bias toward the training distribution. For example, the molecules generated by GENTRL<d-cite key="zhavoronkov2019deep"></d-cite> frequently exhibit strong resemblance to known active compounds. Some works attempt to explore novelty through fragment-based RL or prioritized replay<d-cite key="yang2021hit"></d-cite>, but these methods are still constrained by the fragments derived from known molecules and incur high computational costs. Even recent diffusion models like GDSS<d-cite key="jo2022score"></d-cite>, while capable of generating high-quality molecular graphs, lack the mechanism to explicitly control the deviation from training data. Furthermore, these models often optimize over simplified properties (e.g., penalized logP, QED) that do not necessarily correlate with real-world drug efficacy<d-cite key="luo2021graphdf"></d-cite>.</p> <h2 id="mood-a-new-paradigm-for-out-of-distribution-generation">MOOD: A New Paradigm for Out-of-Distribution Generation</h2> <figure> <picture> <source class="responsive-img-srcset" media="(max-width: 480px)" srcset="/AI810/assets/img/2025-04-28-paper-2/fig1-480.webp"></source> <source class="responsive-img-srcset" media="(max-width: 800px)" srcset="/AI810/assets/img/2025-04-28-paper-2/fig1-800.webp"></source> <source class="responsive-img-srcset" media="(max-width: 1400px)" srcset="/AI810/assets/img/2025-04-28-paper-2/fig1-1400.webp"></source> <img src="/AI810/assets/img/2025-04-28-paper-2/fig1.png" width="auto" height="auto" onerror="this.onerror=null; $('.responsive-img-srcset').remove();"> </picture> </figure> <div class="caption"> <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2206.07632" target="_blank" rel="external nofollow noopener noopener noreferrer">Figure 1: Concept Figure of MOOD.</a> </div> <p>MOOD introduces a new framework for molecule generation that targets two fundamental challenges: (1) generating molecules that are <strong>truly novel and out-of-distribution (OOD)</strong>, and (2) ensuring that these molecules <strong>satisfy real-world drug-like properties</strong>. MOOD achieves this by a novel <strong>OOD-controlled score-based diffusion process</strong>, together with <strong>gradient-based conditional generation</strong>. Unlike traditional reinforcement learning approaches or fragment-based generators, MOOD operates without additional training overhead or sampling complexity, and enables flexible control over how far the generation deviates from the training distribution.</p> <h3 id="score-based-generative-modeling-with-sdes">Score-based Generative Modeling with SDEs</h3> <p>MOOD builds upon GDSS <d-cite key="jo2022score"></d-cite>, which models graphs using a system of stochastic differential equations (SDEs). The molecular graph is represented as \(G_t = (X_t, A_t)\), where \(X_t\) are node features and \(A_t\) is the adjacency matrix.</p> <p>The forward SDE is:</p> \[dG_t = f_t(G_t)\,dt + g_t\,d\omega,\] <p>and the reverse-time diffusion becomes:</p> \[\begin{aligned} dX_t &amp;= \left[ f_{1,t}(X_t) - g_{1,t}^2 \nabla_{X_t} \log p_t(X_t, A_t) \right] dt + g_{1,t} d\bar{\omega}_1, \\\\ dA_t &amp;= \left[ f_{2,t}(A_t) - g_{2,t}^2 \nabla_{A_t} \log p_t(X_t, A_t) \right] dt + g_{2,t} d\bar{\omega}_2, \end{aligned}\] <p>using learned score networks \(s_{\theta_1,t}, s_{\theta_2,t}\). (More details about GDSS can be found in Blog Post “Score-based Generative Modeling of Graphs via the System of Stochastic Differential Equations”).</p> <h3 id="expanding-the-exploration-space-with-ood-control">Expanding the Exploration Space with OOD Control</h3> <p>To expand the exploration space of the diffusion, MOOD introduces a novel OOD-controlled score-based graph generative model that can generate samples <strong>outside the in-distribution</strong>, where the OOD-ness is controlled by a hyperparameter \(\lambda \in [0, 1)\).</p> <p>We model this by sampling from the conditional distribution:</p> \[p_t(G_t \mid y_o = \lambda),\] <p>where \(y_o\) denotes the OOD control condition. The reverse-time SDE becomes:</p> \[dG_t = \left[ f_t(G_t) - g_t^2 \nabla_{G_t} \log p_t(G_t \mid y_o = \lambda) \right] dt + g_t d\bar{\omega}. \tag{3}\] <p>The conditional score can be decomposed as:</p> \[\nabla_{G_t} \log p_t(G_t \mid y_o = \lambda) = \nabla_{G_t} \log p_t(G_t) + \nabla_{G_t} \log p_t(y_o = \lambda \mid G_t). \tag{4}\] <p>While \(\nabla_{G_t} \log p_t(G_t)\) can be estimated by the score networks \(s_{\theta_1,t}, s_{\theta_2,t}\), the OOD condition term is modeled as:</p> \[p_t(y_o = \lambda \mid G_t) \propto p_t(G_t)^{-\sqrt{\lambda}}.\] <p>This implies that low-likelihood samples are more likely to be considered OOD, which is inspired by <d-cite key="du2019implicit"></d-cite> and <d-cite key="grathwohl2019your"></d-cite>, encouraging the model to explore underrepresented regions of chemical space.</p> <h3 id="conditional-generation-for-property-optimization">Conditional Generation for Property Optimization</h3> <p>MOOD further modifies generation to favor molecules with desirable chemical properties using conditional generation. Here, the objective is to sample from the joint conditional distribution:</p> \[p_t(G_t \mid y_o = \lambda, y_p),\] <p>where $y_p$ represents a property condition such as high binding affinity, drug-likeness. This is decomposed using Bayes’ rule:</p> \[p_t(G_t \mid y_o = \lambda, y_p) \propto p_t(G_t) \, p_t(y_o = \lambda \mid G_t) \, p_t(y_p \mid G_t, y_o = \lambda).\] <p>The property term \(p_t(y_p \mid G_t, y_o = \lambda)\) is modeled with a Boltzmann distribution:</p> \[p_t(y_p \mid G_t, y_o = \lambda) = \frac{1}{Z_t} \exp\left( \alpha_t P_\phi(G_t, \lambda) \right),\] <p>where $P_\phi$ is a learned property prediction function and $\alpha_t$ is a scaling parameter. Substituting this into the reverse-time SDE gives:</p> \[dG_t = \left[ f_t(G_t) - (1 - \sqrt{\lambda}) g_t^2 \nabla_{G_t} \log p_t(G_t) - \alpha_t g_t^2 \nabla_{G_t} P_\phi(G_t, \lambda) \right] dt + g_t d\bar{\omega},\] <p>where the last term encourages sampling toward regions with higher predicted property values.</p> <p>Therefore, following the form of GDSS<d-cite key="jo2022score"></d-cite>, this can be seperated into node features $X_t$ and adjacency matrix $A_t$ as below:</p> \[\begin{aligned} dX_t &amp;= \left[ f_{1,t}(X_t) - (1 - \sqrt{\lambda}) g_{1,t}^2 s_{\theta_1,t}(X_t, A_t) - \alpha_{1,t} g_{1,t}^2 \nabla_{X_t} P_\phi(X_t, A_t, \lambda) \right] dt + g_{1,t} d\bar{\omega}_1, \\ dA_t &amp;= \left[ f_{2,t}(A_t) - (1 - \sqrt{\lambda}) g_{2,t}^2 s_{\theta_2,t}(X_t, A_t) - \alpha_{2,t} g_{2,t}^2 \nabla_{A_t} P_\phi(X_t, A_t, \lambda) \right] dt + g_{2,t} d\bar{\omega}_2, \end{aligned}\] <p>where $s_{\theta_1,t}$ and $s_{\theta_2,t}$ are score networks approximating the partial derivatives of the log data density with respect to $X_t$ and $A_t$, respectively.</p> <p>To balance the influence of the score and property gradients, MOOD dynamically adjusts the weighting coefficients:</p> \[\alpha_{1,t} = \frac{r_{1,t} \| s_{\theta_1,t}(G_t) \|}{\| \nabla_{X_t} P_\phi(G_t, \lambda) \|}, \quad \alpha_{2,t} = \frac{r_{2,t} \| s_{\theta_2,t}(G_t) \|}{\| \nabla_{A_t} P_\phi(G_t, \lambda) \|},\] <p>where $r_{1,t}$ and $r_{2,t}$ are manually defined scaling ratios. This ensures that the property optimization does not overpower or vanish relative to the diffusion guidance.</p> <h3 id="property-prediction-network-architecture">Property Prediction Network Architecture</h3> <p>To approximate the property function \(P_\phi\), MOOD trains a dedicated neural network on molecule-property pairs. This model predicts properties such as docking score, QED, and synthetic accessibility from graph inputs:</p> \[P_\phi(G_t) := \text{MLP}_s(\tanh(H')),\] <p>where</p> \[H' = \text{MLP}_s\left( \left[ H_0, H_1, ..., H_L \right] \right) \odot \text{MLP}_t\left( \left[ H_0, H_1, ..., H_L \right] \right).\] <p>Here, \(H_0 = X_t\), and each \(H_{l+1} = \text{GNN}(H_l, A_t)\), using a Graph Convolutional Network (GCN). The final feature is passed through two MLPs, one with a sigmoid and the other with a tanh activation, and their outputs are combined by element-wise multiplication to yield the final property score.</p> <p>Overall, by focusing on OOD generation and property optimization, MOOD enables both controlled exploration and the generation of chemically meaningful molecules.</p> <h2 id="experimental-results">Experimental Results</h2> <h3 id="novel-molecule-generation">Novel Molecule Generation</h3> <p>To evaluate MOOD’s ability to generate truly novel molecules, expriment was conducted in unconstrained OOD generation task, so generating molecules without explicitly optimizing for chemical properties. The goal is to validate whether MOOD’s $\lambda$-controlled diffusion process can produce molecules that systematically deviate from the training data distribution. Trained on ZINC250k dataset, MOOD generates 3000 molecules using different values of $\lambda$, with the property optimized term $P_\phi$ removed. The following metrics are used to evaluate the novelty and diversity of the generated molecules:</p> <ul> <li> <p><strong>Fréchet ChemNet Distance (FCD)</strong>: Measures distributional shift in learned chemical representations between training and generated sets<d-cite key="preuer2018frechetchemnetdistancemetric"></d-cite>.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>NSPDK MMD</strong>: Measures structural differences based on graph kernel statistics<d-cite key="costa2010fast"></d-cite>.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Novelty Score</strong>: The fraction of valid molecules that have a Tanimoto similarity less than 0.4 to their closest neighbor in the training data<d-cite key="jin2020multi"></d-cite><d-cite key="xie2021mars"></d-cite>.</p> \[\text{Novelty} = \frac{\text{# of valid molecules with } \text{Tanimoto}(m, m') &lt; 0.4}{\text{Total # of valid generated molecules}}\] </li> </ul> <figure> <picture> <source class="responsive-img-srcset" media="(max-width: 480px)" srcset="/AI810/assets/img/2025-04-28-paper-2/fig3-480.webp"></source> <source class="responsive-img-srcset" media="(max-width: 800px)" srcset="/AI810/assets/img/2025-04-28-paper-2/fig3-800.webp"></source> <source class="responsive-img-srcset" media="(max-width: 1400px)" srcset="/AI810/assets/img/2025-04-28-paper-2/fig3-1400.webp"></source> <img src="/AI810/assets/img/2025-04-28-paper-2/fig3.png" width="auto" height="auto" onerror="this.onerror=null; $('.responsive-img-srcset').remove();"> </picture> </figure> <div class="caption"> <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2206.07632" target="_blank" rel="external nofollow noopener noopener noreferrer">Figure 3: (Left) UMAP visualization of the ZINC250k dataset and the generated molecules by the proposed OOD-controlled diffusion process.

This would be especially beneficial for <strong>structure-based drug design</strong>, where spatial complementarity plays a critical role.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>End-to-End Differentiable Docking</strong><br> While MOOD uses a learned property predictor \(P_\phi\) to approximate scores like docking affinity, it does not simulate actual protein–ligand interactions. One possible extension could done by replacing or augmenting \(P_\phi\) with <strong>differentiable or learned docking simulators</strong>, such as DiffDock, EquiBind, that directly model the binding between a molecule and a protein target. This would allow end-to-end optimization grounded in real physical interaction modeling, improving the relevance of generated candidates for biochemical evaluation.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Multi-agent or Population-based Exploration</strong><br> Inspired by <strong>evolutionary strategies</strong>, MOOD could be extended to use <strong>multiple agents or a population of models</strong> exploring different regions of chemical space in parallel. Such an approach would increase diversity and robustness in molecule discovery, potentially leading to more novel and optimal candidates by escaping local optima through collaborative or competitive exploration dynamics.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Generalization to Other Modalities</strong><br> With the score-based generative modeling, OOD control, and property-conditioned sampling, MOOD could potentially be adapted to other structured domains like <strong>protein design</strong>, <strong>material discovery</strong>, or <strong>neural architecture search</strong>, where goal-conditioned and diverse generation is essential.</p> </li> </ul> <h2 id="extending-mood-incorporating-3d-structural-information">Extending MOOD: Incorporating 3D Structural Information</h2> <p>In this section, I propose a potential extension of MOOD by integrating <strong>3D structural information</strong> of target proteins into the generative process. While MOOD currently operates only in the 2D topological space of molecules, <strong>ligand–protein interactions are fundamentally 3D</strong>, and incorporating spatial constraints from protein binding pockets can improve biological relevance.</p> <p>The 3D-aware MOOD framework could be designed as follows:</p> <ol> <li> <p><strong>Protein Pocket Encoder</strong><br> A neural encoder processes the 3D structure of a protein binding site, represented as a voxel grid, surface mesh, or point cloud, to produce a latent descriptor \(p \in \mathbb{R}^d,\) capturing shape and electrochemical features relevant for binding.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Conditioned Property Predictor</strong><br> The property prediction network \(P_\phi(G_t, \lambda)\) is augmented to incorporate protein context as \(P_\phi(G_t, \lambda, p),\) allowing MOOD to optimize molecules for both chemical properties and spatial compatibility with the target site.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Modified Reverse-Time SDE</strong><br> The conditional diffusion process is updated to guide generation with both OOD control and protein-specific gradients:</p> \[dG_t = \left[ f_t(G_t) - (1 - \sqrt{\lambda}) g_t^2 \nabla_{G_t} \log p_t(G_t) - \alpha_t g_t^2 \nabla_{G_t} P_\phi(G_t, \lambda, p) \right] dt + g_t d\bar{\omega}.\] </li> </ol> <p>This protein-aware extension of MOOD offers several advantages:</p> <ul> <li> <strong>Target-specific Design</strong>: Molecules are generated to be spatially compatible with specific protein pockets, improving hit rates in structure-based drug discovery.</li> <li> <strong>End-to-End Learning</strong>: Gradients from the property predictor can be backpropagated through the binding site encoder, enabling joint optimization of ligands and binding-site representations.</li> <li> <strong>Flexible Integration</strong>: This formulation can incorporate various protein representations, including pretrained geometric encoders or differentiable docking modules.</li> </ul> <p>Possible issues such as the <strong>limited availability of aligned protein–ligand datasets</strong> and the increased complexity of modeling in 3D can be mitigated using transfer learning from structural databases such as PDBbind, or by leveraging pretrained protein encoders like those used in AlphaFold2 or EquiBind.</p> </d-article> <d-appendix> <d-footnote-list></d-footnote-list> <d-citation-list></d-citation-list> </d-appendix> </div> <d-bibliography src="/AI810/assets/bibliography/2025-04-28-paper-2.bib"></d-bibliography> <d-article id="bibtex-container" class="related highlight"> For attribution in academic contexts, please cite this work as <pre id="bibtex-academic-attribution">
